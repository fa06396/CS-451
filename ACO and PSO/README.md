## Swarm Intelligence

The main focus of the assignment is on swarm intelligence, specifically Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) techniques, which are used to solve complex optimization problems.

## Q-1: Capacitated Vehicle Routing using ACO

In this question, the objective is to solve the capacitated vehicle routing problem (VRP) using the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) technique. The VRP is a combinatorial optimization problem that involves determining the optimal set of routes for a fleet of vehicles to traverse in order to deliver to a given set of customers. The problem instances to test the implementation are provided in the instances directory.

## Q-2: Visualizing Swarms

For this part, a simulation was built to visualize swarm algorithms using Processing language in Python mode. The chosen swarm algorithm for visualization is Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The visualization aims to provide an intuitive representation of how PSO works. Additionally, other swarm algorithms such as Ant Clustering and Particle System can also be explored.
