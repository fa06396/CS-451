## Reinforcement Learning and SOM Project

This project focuses on implementing a basic reinforcement learning agent that navigates in a grid world. The objective is to train the agent to maximize its reward by finding the optimal path while avoiding obstacles.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to implement reinforcement learning and self organizing maps to solve specific problems and gain practical experience in computational intelligence techniques.

## Question 1: Training the Reinforcement Learning Agent

In this question, you will train a reinforcement learning agent to navigate a grid world. The agent's goal is to maximize its reward by finding the optimal path while avoiding obstacles. The agent will learn the value function through episodic learning, updating the value of each encountered state based on the outcome of the episode. During the episodes, actions will be selected using Boltzman distribution. Different configurations of the grid will be tested to ensure the agent's generality.

You want to minimize unnecessary movement of agent and make them take optimal actions.

## Question 2: Clustering World Data using SOM

In this question, you will build Self Organizing Maps (SOM) on a world dataset of your choice, such as world poverty data, country-wise environmental data, or COVID-19 data. The goal is to create an effective visualization of the dataset by identifying meaningful clusters based on multiple attributes. The implementation should be generic and capable of handling updated data files with additional rows and columns.
